# Project Requirements

This project is a full-stack web application built with **Next.js (Node.js)**.

All dependencies are defined in `package.json`.


# Project Information

This project uses Cloudinary and Supabase for tracking users, collecting data, and authorization. 

# Limitations
We have encountered a few limitations during the development process. 
The most impactful one is the implementation of the model for number recognition. Despite the fact that we used the YOLO library, the pre-trained weights, and a dataset of 10000 images of electricity meters, the trained model was still not accurate enough. Thus, we decided against implementing it into our final “MVP”. However, that doesn’t mean that it is not possible to use a model for meter readings, but in our case, we took much time studying and had little time left for creating. 
Then, we had trouble creating designs for the badges, other awards and tips since none of us were proficient with Figma. That is why, we opted for the simple emojis. Later on, we will be able to finish it and perfect our leaderboard page.
